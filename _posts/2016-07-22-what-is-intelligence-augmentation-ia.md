  Intelligence augmentation (IA) is the deliberate enhancement of human
  intelligence using some technological means, such as eugenics, gene therapy,
  brain-computer interfaces, nootropics (smart drugs), neuroengineering, or some
  other means that hasn't been invented yet. Occasionally, the term is used to
  refer to external aids such as pen and paper or the Internet, but more
  frequently refers to permanent modifications to the brain that upgrade human
  intelligence.

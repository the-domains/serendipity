      Enterprise software is about to undergo radical transformation - a
      substantial change that will make the shift to software as a service
      (SaaS) look like a simple facelift. This transformation is being powered
      by machine learning. With machine learning, computers can process and mine
      data in real time to automatically discover insights and generate
      predictive models.

  Artificial intelligence (AI) is starting to disrupt the workplace as
  applications powered by machine-learning algorithms begin to permeate
  enterprises at every level. Just who's doing that disrupting - and to whom do
  they report? Data scientists, business architects and quantitative analysts
  (also known as quants) are most often the professionals exploiting the
  burgeoning technology - sometimes under the mantel of the IT department, but
  often not.

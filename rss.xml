            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What Is Intelligence Augmentation (IA)?</h1><p>Intelligence augmentation (IA) is the deliberate enhancement of human intelligence using some technological means, such as eugenics, gene therapy, brain-computer interfaces, nootropics (smart drugs), neuroengineering, or some other means that hasn't been invented yet. Occasionally, the term is used to refer to external aids such as pen and paper or the Internet, but more frequently refers to permanent modifications to the brain that upgrade human intelligence.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c31e3996d5001d7ba14304a07d0f843f/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.wisegeek.com%2Fcomputerized-image-of-human-brain.jpg"></article>]]></description>

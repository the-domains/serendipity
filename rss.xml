            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Jerry Kaplan: "Humans Need Not Apply" | Talks at Google</h1><p>The common wisdom about Artificial Intelligence is that we are building increasingly intelligent machines that will ultimately surpass human capabilities, steal our jobs, possibly even escape human control and take over the world.

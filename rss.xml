Just who's doing that disrupting - and to whom do they report? Data scientists, business architects and quantitative analysts (also known as quants) are most often the professionals exploiting the burgeoning technology - sometimes under the mantel of the IT department, but often not.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4c781810e7986e168a66b3e24f500613/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcore0.staticworld.net%2Fimages%2Farticle%2F2014%2F10%2Fartificial_intelligence_circuit_board_face_thinkstock-100528007-primary.idge.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Jerry Kaplan: "Humans Need Not Apply" | Talks at Google</h1><p>The common wisdom about Artificial Intelligence is that we are building increasingly intelligent machines that will ultimately surpass human capabilities, steal our jobs, possibly even escape human control and take over the world.
